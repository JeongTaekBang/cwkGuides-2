# C.W.K. Tech Guides

![Cover](images/cover.png)

This repository contains a collection of practical guides and technical insights focused on AI and other technical topics. Each guide aims to provide clear, actionable information based on real-world experience.

Every guide is written as a standalone markdown file for simplicity and ease of reading.

These guides are living documents that will be continuously updated and refined based on user feedback and new developments. Please check back regularly for the latest updates. Additionally, due to potential repository restructuring, links may change over time - so rather than just bookmarking specific guide URLs, it's recommended to bookmark the main repository and navigate from there.
